# # Hacking With Swift - SwiftUI

This repository contains all the apps 📱 that I created while taking the **100 days of swiftUI** course from [HackingWithSwift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) website - definitely with my own twists 😁 - not just copy & paste Paul's Code.

I am trying to complete the course ASAP 🏃🏻, **My Approach -**
Watch all the videos 🎥 for a mini project and then build 🏗 an app that can be made using the concepts and learnings of the mini project :)

If stuck at any point - use official docs / stackoverflow / tech-twitter / reddit - try & avoid to re-watch the video !

## ## App 1 : WeSplit 🪙

Paul created a simple single screen app that takes user input (bill amount, number of people and tip %) to calculate the final bill amount for each person.

### ### Concepts Introduced in This App :

1.  Understanding the basic structure of a SwiftUI app
2.  Creating a form
3.  Adding a navigation bar
4.  Modifying program state
5.  Binding state to user interface controls
6.  Creating views in a loop
7.  Reading text from the user with TextField
8.  Creating pickers and sliders in a form
9.  Hiding the keyboard

### ### What I Created - SIP Returns Calculator

A simple single screen app where user inputs his / hers monthly SIP amount, time period in years and get the amount that they will finally get.
